# 🧠 SmartDocAI

SmartDocAI is an intelligent document understanding system that extracts answers to natural language questions from unstructured documents like PDFs, invoices, and scanned reports. It combines Optical Character Recognition (OCR) with Transformer-based QA models (e.g., BERT) to enable deep, searchable insights from documents.

🚀 **Key Features**:
- OCR support for scanned documents (images, PDFs)
- QA using pre-trained Transformers (e.g., DistilBERT fine-tuned on SQuAD)
- Works with both digital and scanned documents
- Clean UI with Gradio (Hugging Face Spaces-ready)

📄 **Use Cases**:
- Extracting totals, dates, or invoice numbers from financial docs
- Interacting with academic PDFs via Q&A
- Building document search and compliance tools
